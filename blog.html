    <h3>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h3>
    <p>
      Var keyword declares a variable which is scoped to its current execution
      context, optionally initializing to a value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let keyword declares a block scoped variable, optionally initializing it
      to a value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Const keyword declares constants which are block scoped much like
      variables defined using let but the value of a constant cannot change. The
      const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value.
    </p>
    <h3>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
    <p>
      Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns
      the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been
      assigned.The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined
      variable.
    </p>
    <h3>What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
    <p>A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.</p>
