     <b>Let:</b> Let keyword declares a block scoped variable, optionally initializing it
      to a value.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
     <b>Const:</b> Const keyword declares constants which are block scoped much like
      variables defined using let but the value of a constant cannot change. The

      interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST
      architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.
